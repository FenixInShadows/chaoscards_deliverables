Select Mode: 
0 (Default): Generate random cards freely.
1 : Generate random cards with specified seeds.
2 : Play against AI using decks generated freely or with specified seeds.
3 : Play against yourself with decks generated with specified seeds.
4 : Simulate AI Vs AI matches between (different) AI's on the same set of random decks (Warning: this may take hours to days).
5 : Simulate AI Vs AI matches (with same AI) for evaluating cards (decks) on the same random card pool with both random and evolutionary deck building/matching scheme (Warning: this may take hours to days).
6 : Simulate AI Vs AI matches (with same AI) between different two small sets of given decks (Warning: this may take hours to days).
7 : Play against AI using decks in either the meta environment (generated by the evolutionary simulation) or the random environment (generated by the random simulation).
8 : Train a card encoder from a randomly generated cards.
9 : Test the card encoder in re-generating the actual card.
10 : Generate cards given the current set up for the conditional VAE.
11 : Learning a balanced card generator through repeated simulation and encoder training.
12 : Test a card generator in terms of balance.
13 : Test manually designed demo card sets.
14 : Produce an html file for a given card set.
15 : Play against AI using decks generated with a given conditional VAE.
